# Daily Highlighted Task App
(The app's name is a WIP, so this is just a placeholder for now.)

The working tagline for the app is "*achieve productive zen*" (with 'zen' being a state of calm attentiveness). I feel that this sums up nicely what this web app is all about—
1. (Re)gaining focus (away from your long to-do list with many tasks—some small, some large—all shouting for your attention);
2. Being truly productive (not just *feeling* productive)... this means:
    - Working on your big tasks/projects—complete tasks that achieve long-term goals, rather than small tasks that seem urgent, but are ultimately unimportant;
    - Single-tasking over multitasking;
    - Avoiding procrastination, distractions, and the temptation to complete other tasks (at least until the main task is complete). 
3. Doing all of the above while using an app that considers the emotional/mindful side of task management and getting tasks done, by trying to make it less stressful, rewarding (through streaks, etc.) and trying to help you to stay focused and stay motivated.     

## Key features
'Core' concept:
- Focus on completing just one big task a day.
- Option to add sub-tasks (enabling the breaking down of the main task).
- Option to plan tomorrow's task.
- Optional notifications.
- The overall design, feel and branding used throughout the app should be friendly, non-intimidating, somewhat joyful and motivational, but the design should also be clean, modern and free from clutter that could distract the user.
    
## Audience
Target audience / potential market(s):
- People who live busy/hectic/stressful lives.
- People who have busy and demanding jobs.
- People who have difficulty concentrating. This could be because of distractions around them, bad habits or conditions such as ADHD.

Users expectations: 
- An app that functions without any bugs or issues.
- A good UI and UX with a modern, clear and appealing design.
- User data is reliably stored at least locally, with the option to have data sync across devices.
- User data is kept private and secure.

Needs (why users may use the app): 
- Some users may need something to help them focus on one big task they need to get done that day (perhaps because of distractions, difficulty concentrating, feeling like they have too many important/urgent tasks on their to-do list, or their to-do list is simply too long and/or messy etc.).
- Some users may find it hard to organise or keep on top of a traditional to-do list, but can manage a simple list that they refresh daily.
- Some users may want to simply remind themselves of what they most need to focus on that day.
- Some users may appreciate the calming/friendly tone of the app that makes them feel less stressed than when using other task management apps.

## Intended technology stack
- MExN stack.
- I don't intend on using a frontend framework. 

## Data
- I would like to offer a free version of the app to users, where data is just kept in the browser's local storage. Then, paid users will have the ability to sync their data across devices. Users on the free version can also use the app without an account. 
- Users on the free version / users without an account will have their data saved to local storage.
- Users on a paid plan will have their data saved to a database. This data may include: today and tomorrow's main task, and sub-tasks; streak data and history; history of completed/uncompleted main tasks to display on the calendar. 
- Users will need to be able to create an account and sign in, as well as change account information (name, passwords, etc.).
